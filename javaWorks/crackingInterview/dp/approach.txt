try to map it to some standard algorithm
Mofify a bit

Standard algos:

1.  Fibinoci series or catlan series
2.  Take or not take
    combination using take or no take variation
    Sub set take or not take
3.  For count the number of ways 
    try come up with an equation
4.  Longest increasing sub sequence
    Max sum such that no two are consecutive (dp[i] = Max(dp[dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+currentValue]) (max of excluded+currentValue  ))
5.  Longest common sub sequence
6.  Coin change or permutation
7.  Evaluate expression - bsaed on the operator make the decidesion on left and right
