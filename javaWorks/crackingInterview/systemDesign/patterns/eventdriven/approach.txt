The flow of date is based on responding to the events created in a system. Mostly asynchronous.
When an event is created and communicated to the downstream systems, the systems needs to process them in sequence or parallel and produce desired results.

So lets see some concepts on how events driven system can
Create events
Communicate events
Processe events at scale
Error handling
Manage - deploying and developing

Creational patterns:
-------------------
Types of messages:
Command 
    - Send a command instruction and expect the receiver to take actions on the same
Document
    - Used to send data between sender and receiver
Event
    - Basically sending a notification
    - Notification - only
    - Notification + metadata
    - Notification + data (ECST)

Event Carried State Transfer (ECST)
    - Events holds the state which other services can pick up and update their local state.
    - When to use ???
    - Drawbacks ???

Command Query Response Segregation (CQRS)
    - Seperate the command and query events
    - When to use ???
    - Drawbacks ???

Change Data Capture (CDC)
    - To capture and process changes made to a database
    - When to use ???
    - Drawbacks ???

Event Sourcing
    - Capturing all changes to an applicationâ€™s state as a sequence of events
    - This sequence of events is used to build and rebuild the state of the application
    - When to use ???
    - Drawbacks ???



Communication Patterns:
-----------------------

Publish subscribe:
    - Publisher is decoupled for the receiver via an intermidiate
