When and where it is used ?
	- Used in ORM frameworks like hibernate
	- When we dont want to go to the DB everytime to get the next value for the sequence number
	- When we want to know the value of primary number before inserting


How ?
	- Simple, let say we have 4 computes/vm running the app.
	- And all 4 are inserting into the DB

	- Now when the first VM boots, it goes to the DB and ask for the current sequence number, which is lets say 36
	- Now we set a Value in our locak HIGH = 35.
	- Now in local we have two other values, BATCH_SIZE (lets say 50) and LOW (0 to 50)
	- Now the next value for the promary key in this VM/app is calculated as key = (HIGH * BATCH_SIZE) + LOW
	- After then we increment the value of LOW.
	- So next time we want to insert into the DB, we use the same formula until we reach LOW = BATCH_SIZE
	- This way we can generate keys for 50 records without going to the DB

	- Now the same, happens in the other 3 VMs. But they may get a HIGH value different like 36 or 36 etc.
