Twitter snowflake

What is snowflake id generator ?

	It is a unique id generator for any usecase. Just like UUID.

When do we use it ?
	Lets say we use UUID to generate unique ids for for records in the data base table.
	So a UUID is a 128 bit value. So lets say we generate a 1lakh records per day, which is very minimal,
	Then how much memory is used to store just the unique ids

	128 / 8 => 16 byte => 0.015 MB
	0.015 * 1,00,000 => 1562 MB => 1.5 GB

	So to just store a primary key for a recods we needs 1.5 GB per day. So how can we reduce it.

	Options:
		Nano Id ?
			Some hardware way

		Simple DB sequence generator
			Hi/low algorithm ?
			Is predictable, and also fails in distributed environemnt


So we got snowflake:

	- It is a 64 bit long value.
	- The first 42 bit is the time stamp. It can be custom epoch, from where we start generating the IDs
	- The next 5 bits, is form the Worker ID (System ID)
	- The next 5 bits, is from the thread ID
	- The remaining 12 is a sequece number from range 0 to 4096 which also looks around

So, when does snowflak would create a duplicate id
	- In the same milisecond (the first 42 bits)
	- The same machine
	- The same thread
	- Server more than 4096 requests.
	- Meaning 4096 requests per millisecond. this is highly inprobable in read world.

So, when the system producing the IDs start/ restart, and boots with a clock tuned back, will it produce duplicates ?
	- Yes, there is a possibility
	- To fix this, the servers needs to follows the NTP protocal
	- Network Time Protocol synchronizes the clocks in the servers
		- NTP works as follows,
			There is a centralized server which has a atomic clock or a GPS clock
			This server has a Stratum value as 0. Then range is 0-15. 0 being the most accurate. Stratum greater than 15 is not reliable
			So we can contact/set a NTP server in our devices like router/server, which sysncs the time with this server
			We usally has a public NTP hosted server, with probably a stratum value of 2 or 3
			When we use this NTP hosted server values, our stratum becoms +1.
			From the devices in our network which we have already synchronized the clock, we can sync other devices with +1 stratus value
