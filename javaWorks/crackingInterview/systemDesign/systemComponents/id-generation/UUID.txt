What is UUID
------------
	- It is basically a number like int or long, only bigger
	- It is a 128 bit integer (long is 64 bit integer)
	- So 16^32 (2^128) possible ids/ numbers

	- In UI form it is represented as a 32 char hexadecimanl values seperated by "-"
	- The UUID is of the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
	- The M is for the version (1/2/3/4)
	- The N is the varient in the version, like version_1 - variant_1


Versions:
---------

	version 1: Time stamp + mac address
		- It will be incremental ID because the time stamp is gone keep increasing.

	version 2: Time stamp + mac address + user ID
		- Similar to version1, but also include userd ID as part of the UUID for security released keys 

	version 3(&5): Name based
		- Uses a namespace or name to generate a UUID
		- For the same name, you always get the same ID
		- Ex: is name is the domain host name, then "google.com" name will aways generate the same ID
		- version 3 uses the MD5 hash
		- version 5 uses the SHA hash

	version 4: Random
		- Totally random generation


When will it collide?
---------------------

	- If we generate 1 billion UUIs in one second for the next 100 years. Then the chance of getting a duplicate is 50%
	- If the UUID is using process for generating some part of it, then when we use child process, we might get duplicates
