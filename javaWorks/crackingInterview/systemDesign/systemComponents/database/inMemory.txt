Why do we need In Memory data bases
	- When we wat to reduce the latency for the disk seeks
	- Reading from disk vs reading from RAM is a HUGE HUGE difference
	- In latency in read and write, 
		- Normal hard disk - ~64 MB/sec READ, 69 MB/sec write
		- SSD - ~400 MB/sec READ, 264 MB/sec write
		- RAM - ~4000 MB/sec READ, 5000 MB/sec write
	- Reading and writing in RAM does not required serialization

How we store in memory
	- As we know we store all values in RAM
	- In disk seek we used the B+ tree to get as fast to the data location
	- In RAM use use AVL tress modifications to get the range queries
	- We also mostly can store values as KEY VALUE pairs

Problems
	- RAM is volatile and can go off when the power goes off

How reliability is maintained
	- Using a secondary thread to create two things
		1. Append only logs for every mutation
		2. Snap shot of the inmemnory values periodically
	- If a ram crashes, we can build the same state using the logs
	- But if the writes are too much, then we might go out of memeory in the disk
		- For that we can periodically trim the logs, so we can maintian only the latest logs
		- Also we can also, delete the logs after a succesufull snapshot creation
