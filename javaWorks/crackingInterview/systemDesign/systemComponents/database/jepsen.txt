Jepsen is an open-source Clojure library, written by Kyle Kingsbury, designed to test the partition tolerance 
of distributed systems by fuzzing them with random operations. 
The results of these tests are analyzed to expose failure modes and to verify if the system 
violates any of the consistency properties it claims to have.

The Jepsen project did an analysis of Cassandra in 2013
