For availability & fault tolerance we need to duplicate data

The challenge is to keep the replicas consistent

consistent - The client should feel as if there is only one copy of the data

Strong consistent model - Where all copies are updated before commiting
  - Primary - backup model provides stong consistency 
  
Eventual consistency - Where the replicas will eventuallu get consistent
  
  
Active & passive replication

Active - Where each replicas EXECUTE the changes individually and apply it to their copy
  - useful when
    - 
Passive - Where only primary EXECUTE the changes and asks the replicas to just update their copies with new value
