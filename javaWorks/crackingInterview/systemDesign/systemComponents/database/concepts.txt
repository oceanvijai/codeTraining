In system design we have the following two scearious
1.	Two general problem
		- Were two generals need to decide on an attacking time
		- Now its possible only if there are no problems in sending msg and getting acks from each other
		- So this explains the failures and hardship in networking
2.	Byzatine generals problem
		- Here there are many generals and some of them are traitor.
		- So when trying to aggree upon one time to attack, the bad generals might give false information when relaying the msgs to others
		- This shows the difficulties in aggreeing upon a time due to faulty/bad nodes


So in general, in a distributed system 3 things needs to be considered

1.	Network (How reliable)
2.	Nodes (crashes)
3.	Timing (clocks, latency etc)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Failure - If the entire system goes down
Fault - Some part of the system goes down due to network/node creash etc

If a system can tollerate some faults (some components goinng down), then its FAULT TOLERANT
If one componnets goes down, and system becomes unavailable (Failure), then its a SINLE POINT OF FAILURE

Fault detecters should be present to achieve FAULT TOLERANT systems
