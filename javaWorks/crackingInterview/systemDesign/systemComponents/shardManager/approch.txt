Provide sharding as a service so engineers dont have to do redo it.

Requirement - This generic sharder should do the following

Fault tolerant - If one node/shard does down, it need to fall back and recover
Maintanence    - For maintanence activites, we need to move data/shard to different server temporarely and back
Load balance   - Make sure the load is evenly distributed in realtime - load balance with request load not data
Hotspot shards - A single shard has more load which a single server cant handle - Add extra replicas for the shard

Shard data
Shard requests
