Consensus is needed when 
	- To elect a leader(node) so the messages can be to dispersed in order (Leader election)
	- Avoid split brain (Two leader)
	- Need to know which are the nodes/processes which can work together (Group membership)
	- Need to get access to a shared resource (Distributed mutual exclusion - lock)
	- It is also used when we want the messages to be accepted in a single value
		- Lets say, whenever we deliver a msg. We make sure they are accepted by a quorum which is a consensus
	- It is also used when we want to deliver/replicate multiple msgs to the followers in the same order (total order broadcast)
		- Lets say, we have multiple events/updates and we need to get a consense before delivering every msg, so when delivered they are in order
	- Distributed transaction commit problems


total order broadcast (released to Delivery gauranties - FIFO, causual & total order gauranty)
	- In a distributed system we tend to replicate data to other nodes for availability
	- When we are sending the data to the replicas, we need to make sure we send the data in the right sequence
		- Meaning, if we get a write request, the leader need to make sure the write requests are sequenced properly, or
		  they might get out in order in network transit
	- So the leader is responsible for making this happen. 
	- But how do we select the leader in the first place ?

State machine replication
	- A way to replicate data from one node to other in a distributed environnment
	- This can be done by total order broadcast, which makes sure events are delivered in order


Crash stop failures ?
	- System in not sure whether a node is crashed or slow

Algos
	- paxos (single value consensus)
		- Multi-Paxos (total order broadcast)
	- Zookeeper atomic broadcast (zab)
		- atomic broadcast ~ totally ordered broadcast
	- Raft
		- Easy to understand View stamped replication :) 
	- View stamped replication
	- Comparisons - white paper - Vive la differnce


- Asynchronous system ?
	- If the system are not bound by any time
	- No system has a SLA
	- Every system can responsd on their own time which is from ms to hours
	- Problem: no difference between a crached system vs one which is delaying

- Synchronous system ? 
	- All the clocks of the systems are synchronized. 
	- No time drifts
	- No/same Network latency
	- Impossible or highly unrealistic

- partially Synchronous ?
	- All have a shared clock, but not completely synchronized
	- Bound by SLAs
	- More realtime
	- We can try and achieve consensus in this system


- Fisher Lynch Paterson (FLP) theorem
	- It is impossible to get a consensus on a asynchronous system.
	- Like CAP it has 3 gaurenties and we need to choose 2 among them
	  - Termination - Each process/nodes eventually decides a value
	  - Agreement - All nodes agress/decides on a same value
	  - Validity - The agreed value should be from the set of proposed values
	- Paxos - may not satisfy Termination gaurenty
