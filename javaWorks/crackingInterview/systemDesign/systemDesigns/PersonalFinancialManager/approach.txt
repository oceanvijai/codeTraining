Explain how you would design a personal financial manager (like
Mint.com). This system would connect to your bank accounts, analyze your spending habits, and
make recommendations. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Requirements

    - We can add or remove bank accounts
    - We can pull transaction history from the banks
    - We need to categorise the transactions 
    - We need to analyse the data based on category and notify/recomend the User
    - The user can change the transaction category

    - For now we are assuming its a web client
    - We can notify the user in a day gap, since we cant pull the transaction data real time

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Solve it
    - We can easily see this is a write heavy, and users might mostly see it once in a week
    - Also mostly the users will get email notifications
    - look into the overall_design.jpeg
    
    - Instead of putting all the trans data into the data base, which will be heavy and waste of space
    - we can put it in a category folder as simple txt files
    - Then we can use two component one to categorise and other to analyse the budget
    - see backend_design.jpeg

    - The categoriser will get the transactions data and put it in a folder
    - This folder is common for all the users
    - Then, a job can be run to group it according to user

    - Then the budget analyser can cummulate all the data and merge it based on category
    - We can then update this to the data table
    - This data can be used to analyse and notify the user accordingly

    - User changing the transaction category can be handled accordingly by removing it from 
      one and adding it to another

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: scale it


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: Design and add scalable components
    - see overall_design and backend_design images

    Follow up:
    How would this change if you also needed to support a mobile app? 

    How would you design the component which assigns items to each category? 

    How would you design the recommended budgets feature? 

    How would you change this if the user could develop rules to categorize all transactions from a particular
    seller differently than the default?
