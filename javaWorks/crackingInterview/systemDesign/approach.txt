Step 1: Requirements

What core problem is the system solving
Who are its users
Key and most important behavious
important behavious requirements on perforamance and Consistency

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Solve

Solve it assuming all the data is in one machine
Identity the most important bottlenecks
Then start to scale it by splitting up the data 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Design and scale

Draw the overall components with a standard design
Fix your design to address the bottlenecks
Fix Consistency, availability and partition problems

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Calculate storage and machine specification

Do the bit/byte calculation for the estimate
The total load
Calculate the processing power
The total storage
