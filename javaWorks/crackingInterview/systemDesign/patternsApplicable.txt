Like for say,

scalability:
    Asynchronous processing
    caching
        Caching at all level like client, middle, data store, network
    message queue
    multi threading
    partition of data and processing servers (load balancing)
    seperate compute scalability from fetch/distribution scalability (facebook live)

Consistency:
    Strong Consistency
    Eventual Consistency
    Consenses protocols

availability:
    Failovers
    Replication
        Master slave replication 
        Master master replication
        Budy replication
