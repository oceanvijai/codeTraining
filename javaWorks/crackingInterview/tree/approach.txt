BFS or DFS

Inorder || preorder || post order

use stack and queue with mix of the above traversals

In validating BST, Inorder with duplicates is a issue, sicnce we dont know from which leaf it came from

Inorder property : Will mostly give you the same result for different tree structure in case of BST
pre porder : will give you different result for same BST with different structure, which is good for classification
port order also gives different result for same BST with different structure

When trying brute force:
Do a trvaesal from the current node to the end.
And then ask the left to do the same
And then the right to do the same
