BFS or DFS

Inorder || preorder || post order

In validating BST, Inorder with duplicates is a issue, sicnce we dont know from which leaf it came from

Inorder property : Will mostly give you the same result for different tree structure in case of BST
pre porder : will give you different result for same BST with different structure, which is good for classification
port order also gives different result for same BST with different structure
