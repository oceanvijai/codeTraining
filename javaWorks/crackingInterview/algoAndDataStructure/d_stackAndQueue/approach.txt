If you want to arrange/manage the numbers/chars on some constraints
Which element is the next best than the current index

Applications:
    - stack - to evalution of expression and conversion
    - min stack
    - Largest area in a rectangle

    - Monotone queue - sliding window


Max queue:
    push: push an element into the queue; O (1) (amortized)
    pop: pop an element out of the queue; O(1) (pop = remove, it can't report this element)
    max: report the max element in queue;O(1)
