HashMap impl

Hash collision

Hash funtction techniques:
1. If we have a hash code and which will change and we need to do the change in the hashcode itself. Try this one
    Each char in the hashcode can be a digit. The digit can be base x where x is the number of possible options available for that char.
    Ex: We need to hash a chess board state and change it state
        We have 4 types of pieces + 2 colours + 1 empty. so totally 13 values are possible. So we need 4 bits to represent 13 pieces.
        So, 64 char lenght hashcode can be created with each char with a digit which is base 13. like 0=empty, 1=blackKing, 2=blackQueen... 9=somePiece, A=somePiece,B&C.
