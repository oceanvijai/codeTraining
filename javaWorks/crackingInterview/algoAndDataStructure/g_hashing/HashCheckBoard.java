      Design a hash function for chess game states. 
      Your function should take a state and the hash code for that state, and a move, and efficiently compute the hash code for the updated state

  /**
      Approach 1: We have 4 types of pieces + 2 colours + 1 empty. so totally 13 values are possible. So we need 4 bits to represent 13 pieces.
      So, 64 char lenght hashcode can be created with each char with a digit which is base 13. 
      like 0=empty, 1=blackKing, 2=blackQueen... 9=somePiece, A=somePiece,B&C. 

      Approach 2:
