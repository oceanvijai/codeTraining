     * passes through any other keys, the other keys must have previously selected

        | 7 | 8 | 9 |
        Invalid move: 4 - 1 - 3 - 6 
        Line 1 - 3 passes through key 2 which had not been selected in the pattern.

        Invalid move: 4 - 1 - 9 - 2
        Line 1 - 9 passes through key 5 which had not been selected in the pattern.

        Valid move: 2 - 4 - 1 - 3 - 6
        Line 1 - 3 is valid because it passes through key 2, which had been selected in the pattern

        Valid move: 6 - 5 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 2
        Line 1 - 9 is valid because it passes through key 5, which had been selected in the pattern.
