Let say we have an array of numbers and we need to find its sum

This sum can be be a range also, like sum from 3 to 7.

For this we can use a DP sum array to store the sum at every index and do this

But the problem is if, the values change in runtime, we have to do O(n) update

So we can use a Segment tree or Binary Indexed tree

Segement tree can do the update and getSum in O(logn) times

///ly, Binary Indexed tree can also do the same
