Use the basic math and if required come with equaltions

prime   - any even number can be represented as a product of two prime number

GCD     - GCD of two numbers is the biggest number what can divide both.
            Ex: GCD(54,24)
            Factors of 54 = 1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54
            factors of 24 = 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24
            So, GCD = 6 which divdes both an the largest
