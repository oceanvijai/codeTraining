Adjacency list & matrix

BFS
Bipartate graph

DFS
	Topolical sort
	Articulation point
		- Tarjan Algo
		- Week edge/node which will disconnect the graph

Disjoint set
	Rank and path compression
	- For graphs which are built incrementely and involves grouping etc

cycle in a 
	- directed 
	- undirected 

mininum spaning tree
	Prim's 
	Kruskal 

shortest path
	Toposort 
	Dijstrak's single source shortest path
	Belman ford single source shortest path
	A* (Dijstrak + extra heuristic to steer the expasion in the right direction)

all pair shortest path
	- Floyd warshal 

Strongly connected components
	- Kosaraju's Algorithm
	- Strongly connected component is where each node can reach other nodes
	- Application
		- social network - SCC is like a group of friend in a social network. If we find scc we can suggest friends to others in the network
		- recomendation - SCC is like a group/cluster which has two or more common task. So a recomendation system can find suggestion using the scc
		- Transport connectivity 


Traveling salesman problem
Hamiltonian cycle

Maximum Flow
	- Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
