A tree formed from a weighted graph, such that the sum of the edges are minimum

-  Properties
    - The weights are minimum

- Application
    - find the min wire required to connect every houses
    - find the number of clusters from a list of given points (Machine learning)

Algorithm: Prims algorithm
    - Has a Map <distance> to store the min weight of the edge can produce
    - Has a Map <Parent> to store from where it gets connected to the graph
    - Has a Set <visited> to store from where it gets connected to the graph
    - start from a vertex v, update take all its edges
    - mark it as visited
    - for every edge u, fill the min in the cost graph and update the parent if necessary (meaning if the parent produced the min weight)
    - Now from the distance store we get the next discovered minimum unvisited edge
    - again do the process

    - O (n) for getting the next best vertex * O(e) for every edge where e = n in worst case.
    - O(n * n) algo

    - But for a sparse grap(edges are linear to the vertices)
    - If we use a heap to get the next min discovered vertex, we get O(logV E) or O(E logV) 
        E - E for the total umber of edges
        LogV - For everytime it updates (delete and add) the vertex heap it does logV in the heap
        O(1) to get from the heap
    - If we have a Fibonacci heap - Lazy data structure
        O(VlogV + E)

Follow ups:
1.    Given an MINIMUM spanning tree, add a new EDGE (not vertex) to the tree, such that it remains a MST
        - A MST is a tree and when we add a egde it creates a cycle
        - So do a DFS and get the biggest egde in the path of the cycle - O(n)
        - then again DFS to delete the largest edge - O(n)

2.    If we delete a particular edge from the MST change
        - if the edge is not part of MST, we have no issues
        - When a edge gets deleted we get two components O(m+n)
        - So get the min edge which will connect to the delete edge vertex O(n)

3.    If we add a constant c to all the edges of a graph. Will the before and after MST be the same.
      No, because, lets say the sapnning tree has 3 vertices, like 1->2(1), 2->3(1), 1->3(3)
      So the MST now will be 1->2->3 and the value is 3.
      Now lets add a constant 2 to all the edges.
      Now graph becomes, 1->2(3), 2->3(3), 1->3(5), the MST will 1->2, 1->3 and the values is

kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree:
    - This can also find the minimum spanning tree as follows
    - Sort the edges based on the weight
    - The add every edge such that it does not create a cycle (use UNION FIND or RANK and PATH compression)
    - Then when are done with v verteices, we are done
    - O(ElogE) for sorting, O(E log V) for the RANK and PATH COMPRESSION
    - So, O(ELogE + ELogV) => O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)

Prims vs kruskals

If the graph is not connected (two or more componets), then kruskals will find the min span tree in all the connected componets.
Prims will not do that
