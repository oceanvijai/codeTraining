A tree formed from a weighted graph, such that the sum of the edges are minimum

-  Properties
    - The weights are minimum

- Application
    - find the min wire required to connect every houses
    - find the number of clusters from a list of given points (Machine learning)

Algorithm: Prims algorithm
    - Has a Map <distance> to store the min weight of the edge can produce
    - Has a Map <Parent> to store from where it gets connected to the graph
    - Has a Set <visited> to store from where it gets connected to the graph
    - start from a vertex v, update take all its edges
    - mark it as visited
    - for every edge u, fill the min in the cost graph and update the parent if necessary (meaning if the parent produced the min weight)
    - Now from the distance store we get the next discovered minimum unvisited edge
    - again do the process

    - O (n) for getting the next best vertex * O(e) for every edge where e = n in worst case.
    - O(n * n) algo

    - But for a sparse grap(edges are linear to the vertices)
    - If we use a heap to get the next min discovered vertex, we get O(logV E) or O(E logV) 
        E - E for the total umber of edges
        LogV - For everytime it updates (delete and add) the vertex heap it does logV in the heap
        O(1) to get from the heap
    - If we have a Fibonacci heap - Lazy data structure
        O(VlogV + E)

Follow ups:
1.    Given an MINIMUM spanning tree, add a new EDGE (not vertex) to the tree, such that it remains a MST
        - A MST is a tree and when we add a egde it creates a cycle
        - So do a DFS and get the biggest egde in the path of the cycle - O(n)
        - then again DFS to delete the largest edge - O(n)

2.    If we delete a particular edge from the MST change
        - if the edge is not part of MST, we have no issues
        - When a edge gets deleted we get two components O(m+n)
        - So get the min edge which will connect to the delete edge vertex O(n)

kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree:
    - This can also find the minimum spanning tree as follows
    - Sort the edges based on the weight
    - The add every edge such that it does not create a cycle (use UNION FIND or RANK and PATH compression)
    - Then when are done with v verteices, we are done
    - O(ElogE) for sorting, O(E log V) for the RANK and PATH COMPRESSION
    - So, O(ELogE + ELogV) => O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prims vs kruskals

If the graph is not connected (two or more componets), then kruskals will find the min span tree in all the connected componets.
Prims will not do that


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNION FIND 

It is a simple set operation for graph.
Using this we find, min span tree and detect cycles.
We can detect cycles and remove them froom the graph as well.
We can find connected componets


First sort all the edges based on some parameter/weight (optional)
Pick one edge after the other.
See to which set vertices of the curret edge belongs to. If there are no set create a new one. 
If they belong to two different set. Perform union of the set.
If the belong to the same set, then there is a cycle. Ignore the edge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rank and Path compression

It is the same as above (UNION FIND), instead of set, we achieve it though parent relation.
First sort the edges
Pick edges one by one.
Decide a parent for the picked vertcies. 
For every edge, find if it has a new parent of can be attached to an existing parent.
This parent child relation will form a tree.
When merging two trees, picking the one with the most child.
If a edge has two vertex from the same parent, then its is cycle.
Repeat until all edges are processed

This can be implemented using linked list or better an array.
