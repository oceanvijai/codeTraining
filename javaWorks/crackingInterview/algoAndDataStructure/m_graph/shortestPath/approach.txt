shortest path from one to another
    -   Dijkstra's Algo
    -   Same a Prime's algo except for one line
    -   i.e, we need to get a shortest path of a vertex , by also adding the cost of the vertex that connects it
    

Time: O(EV) or O(V*V) or O(ElogV) with heap or O(VlogV + E) for fibonacci heap

fibonacci heap:
    - Lazy data structure
    - It delays certain operation for optimization


Bellmen ford Algo:  - This can find the shortest path even if there are -ve weights
                    - Seems this is similare to Dijkstra which is usign the same distance relation
                    - Only varies in few conditions
                    - O(V^2)

All pair shortest path
    - We can do Dijkstra from every verted to every other O(n^3)
    - FloydWarshallAllPairShortestPath algo
        - It has the same O(n^3)
        - No probelem if -ve weight is present
        - shortest path from i to j, then its is has a shortest path from i -> k and k -> j
        - so we have 3 loops, one for k and other two for i and j

K the shortest path:
    - NP HARD
    - Dijkstra for k
