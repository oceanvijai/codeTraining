BFS : O(v+E) - v - vertices, E - edges
    The parent relation with the map is can be used to find the shortest path

Properties:
    -   In an undirected graph, it is used to find the shortest path
    -   Find number of connected components
    -   Find a bipartite graph
    -   network flow

Applications
    - Web crawling
    - Social network - friend find
    - grabage collection
    - Solving puzzle and games
    - Find a bipartite graph

bipartite - if we can color the graph with two colors without conflicts
          - can be solved using BFS
Applications:
    - Students and the course they take
    - Sex replationship - male and female sex replationship
