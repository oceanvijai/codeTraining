All pair shortest path (DP)
    - We can do Dijkstra from every verted to every other O(n^3)
    - FloydWarshallAllPairShortestPath algo
        - It has the same O(n^3)
        - No probelem if -ve weight is present
        - shortest path from i to j, then its is has a shortest path from i -> k and k -> j
        - so we have 3 loops, one for k and other two for i and j
        - If there is a -ve cycle edge, then the diagonals of the matrix will have -ve number instead of zero. Refer the code.
