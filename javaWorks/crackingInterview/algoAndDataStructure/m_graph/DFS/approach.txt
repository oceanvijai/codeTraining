DFS: O(v+E) - v - vertices, E - edges

Properties:
    - Find cycles in a graph
    - It can produce the tree edges, forward edges, back edges and cross edges
    - Topological sort in a directed graph
    - Articulation vertices - a vertex when deleted will make the graph diconnected

Applications:
    - Job scheduling using Topological sort
    - build machine etc


 Articulation vertices:
    - Suppose you want to disconnect the graph how would you do it ?
    - So try deleting one edge and do DFS - O(V(V+E))
