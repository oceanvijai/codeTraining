BFS
    - shortest path
DFS
    - cycles
    -   topological sort

All path -  (Gdrive)
Strongly connected graph - http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/ (Gdrive)

bipartite - if we can color the graph with two colors without conflicts
          - can be solved using BFS
Applications:
    - Students and the course they take
    - Sex replationship - male and female sex replationship


Prims

-   All shortest path
