BFS
    - shortest path
DFS
    -   cycles
    -   topological sort
    -   Disjoint set: OPTIONAL
            We can find cycle using disjoint set as well

All path -  (Gdrive)
Strongly connected graph - http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/ (Gdrive)

bipartite - if we can color the graph with two colors without conflicts
          - can be solved using BFS
Applications:
    - Students and the course they take
    - Sex replationship - male and female sex replationship



Prims

-   All shortest path

Dikstra

Traveling sale sman - I think application of backtracking + DFS

OPTIONALS:

network flow - FordFulkerson
    - Augmented path - a path from vertex to sink whoes capacity is min
                     - This is changing at runtime
    - capacity - weight of the edge
    - flow - How much is actulaly flowing through
    - Resudial capacity - capacity - flow
