Preprocess the array or string if possible before any processing
like:
We can do the following 

count
    and store in hasp map 
    or bit map
Reverse
Reduce
Memorize:
    Using hasp map
    Using bit map
sort
split / append
Sum them
DP them
Two/multiple pointers
DP them





For Questions like longest common sub sequence (m*n), 
longest palindrom substring (m*n), 
substring search (m*n RabinKarp)
We have an alternative, called Suffix tree which can do it in linear time (m+n).
Also, another alternative is Suffix array, which can also do it in linear time (m+n)
