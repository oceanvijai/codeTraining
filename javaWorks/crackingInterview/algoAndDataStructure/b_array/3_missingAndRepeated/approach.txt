// Ways to approach

1.    Count - count the number of occurences using array or hashmap
2.    Sort - Sort and find in the array
3.    Sum/equation - make equaltions to find the elements
4.    Bitwise 
		- to get the elements like XOR
		- sometimes count the individual bits and see if mod will work
5.    Maker - use the own array and mark its index with -ve value if found
6.    Runner - linked list cycle find technique
7.    Moore's voting algorithm

----------
1.  Count
    - Count the numbers and put them in array or hashMap snd then process them

2.  Sort
    - Sort the array and get the missing or repeated 
    - This is ofcourse O(nlogn) which we will want to avoid
3.  Sum
    - Form a equation based on the given inputs 
    - Then solve the equation by getting the values out of the array
4.  Bitwise
    - basically XOR can help in many cases
    - If lets say we have a array where all elements repeat 3 times, but one number does not repeat
    	- In this case we can count each bit positions and mod it with 3. We will get 1 for the number/bit which came just once
5.	Maker
	See if we use the input array and encode in some form show we can know if its visited or not.
	Most simple form of encoding can be making it -(value)
	But this can be done only if numbers in the array are in the range of the length of the array.

6.	The need to use it only if we are asked not to modify the input array

7.  If the repeated elements are the majority (in order of n/2), then cancel each repeating element with other numner
    - Finally only the majority element will be left out
