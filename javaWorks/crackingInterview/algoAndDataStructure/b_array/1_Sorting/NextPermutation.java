     * 
     * If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest
     * possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

     * The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.
     * 
     * Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its
     * corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

     *  3,2,1 â†’ 1,2,3
     *  1,1,5 â†’ 1,5,1
