Sort:

important metrics for chosing a sorting algo
1.  Time complexity
2.  Space complexity
3.  Stability
4.  Type of data we are sorting (like integer for radix sort)

External sorting:
    When we have a very very very huge data that needs to be sorted we need to use this.
    Basically we only fit what we can in the main memory and sort them in chuks and finally merge them

    How to do External sort ? (https://youtu.be/YjFI9CJy6x0?t=44m58s)
        Use a merge sort of smaller chunks and store them in the same/different space in the disk
        Then we take on page from these merged chunks and put them in the right place back

        Basically we dont take all of it in the main merory, we take whatever we can from these sorted chunks and merge them back
