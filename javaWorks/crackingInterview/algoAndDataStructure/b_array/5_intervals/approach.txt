If we have a problem that deals with values distributed across a timeline/range, use this technique

Like, hotel bookings, people birth and death dates, likes in a day

when this happens, we have three tricks to solve this problems,

1.  Merge intervals
2.  Two pointer technique
3.  Time map technique
4.  Skyline problem

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merge interval:
---------------

Algorithm is simple: 

Pre-requesties: the interval needs to be SORTED based on start time
---------------
1.  take two pointer as start and end
    Initilize it with the first interval start and end

2.  start iteration from the second interval

3.  If end > current interval start updated the end to MAX(end, current.end)
    this way we are expanding the interval

4.  If the end < current.start
    Then the previour interval ends here. And new interval start here

5.  continue this until the end of the input

for Implementation look in the MergeInterval.java


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two pointer technique
---------------------
This we can apply if we need not match the start and end of the given intervals.
Meaning the result we are looking for is a single value calculated in between these intervals

Algorithm is also simple: 
-------------------------
Pre-requesties: we need two array one with start times and other with end time both SORTED

1.  take two pointer (start, end) for the two arrays

2.  start iteration

3.  If start < end, increment start and increment/any operation the ans.
    Here, we are basically, saying one event happend here before the end time, so I am counting

4.  Update the answer if necessary

5.  else, increment the end pointer and decrement the ans
    Here, we are saying the end event occured, so will updated my answer accordingly

6.  Continue till the end of any array as needed

for Implementation look in the HotelBooking.java // birth and death

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time map technique: O(n^2)
------------------
Use this either if the intervals are not sorted, or there is a mapping between the start and end like we
need as max/min at any point of time

Algorithm is even simple:

1.  Create an array from the start to the end of the interval -> timeLine

2.  Iterate over the intervals and update the timeLine based for both the start and the end time

3.  Iterate over the timeLine now and calculate the required ans

for Implementation look in the MaxPersonAlive.java // SocialNetworkTimeLine.java // MinPriceAtAnyInterval.java


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skyline problem: O(nlogn)
---------------
Use this either if the intervals are not sorted, or there is a mapping between the start and end like we
need as max/min at any point of time

This is done by Sorting and heap

1.  Create the critical points
2.  Sort the critical points
        Corner cases: (point is reduce the effect of addition or removing from the heap)
            If the start and end of two building are same, then place the Start/higher one first
                - because that gets picked up first during heap processing and the lesser one can be suppressed
            If two buildings has the same start, place the higher one first
                - So we can suppress the effect of the lower one in the heap
            If the two buildings has the same end, then remove the SMALLER one first
                - Cause removing the higher one first will affect the heap immediately
3.  Use a heap (prioity queue or treeMap)
4.  If we see a start, put that into the heap
        If the max changed, then create a new interval
5.  If we see a end, remove its corresponding start from the heap
        If the max changed, then create a new interval
