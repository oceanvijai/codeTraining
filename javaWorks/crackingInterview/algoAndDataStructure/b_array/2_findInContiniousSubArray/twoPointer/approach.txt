We can apply two pointer if the problem is to find/count CONTINIOUS subarrays + a condition

pattern1 : Find min/max subarray which satisfies a condition
pattern2 : Find number of subarrays which replacements + condition
pattern3 : Find number of subarrays which satisfies a condition

Pattern 1: Decide to shrink or expand based on the condidtion 
pattern 2: We do as pattern 1, but we make sure we apply or count the replacement in O(1) and check if the condidtion is met
pattern 3 : 
If the questions is, like given array find subarrays which has 3 characters. Then check for a smallest window and add the previous length to the count:

If the questions is, like given array with find subarrays with a goal. Then we can create a funsdtion f which finds subarrays which are <= goal. Then ans = f(goal) - f(goal-1)
