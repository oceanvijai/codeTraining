The space for recursion is bit tricky but easy.

Lets say a recursion leads to 2^n time complexity. So there are 2^n nodes in the recursion tree.
We may think the space for such algo is 2^n.

But if you look closely, at on point we dont have all the nodes, just one path from root to leaft is in the call stack.
So we can say the space is the depth of the tree, like O(n) sometimes.
