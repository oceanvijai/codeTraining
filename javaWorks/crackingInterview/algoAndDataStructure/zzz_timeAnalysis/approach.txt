Use common sense

For loops find the number of iterations
	- Infact count the number of times, the lines inside the loop executes

For recursion, 
	- First try recursion tree
		- When we plot the recursion tree, 
		- In each level, find if there are any linear operations happening.
		- Then count the number of end/leaf nodes and also in every base condtion what is the operation cost O(1) or O(n)
	- Second either try induction or masters theorem

For simple cases, can apply substition technique
