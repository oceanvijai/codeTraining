Coin pick game:

In the pick-up-coins game, an even number of coins are placed in a line.
Two players take turns at choosing one coin eachâ€”they can only choose from the two coins at the ends of the line. 
The game ends when all the coins have been picked up. 
The player whose coins have the higher total value wins. A player cannot pass his turn.

Design an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum total value for the starting
player in the pick-up-coins game.

This might look like a straight foward recursion and DP as follows, 

For each player we have two choices. Pick from left (begining) or right(end) of the queue.
In that case the recurence relation is as follows,

  leftChoice = coins[left] + sum(left+1, right) - rec(left+1, right) // Since rec(left+1, right) is what B will get from index left-1 to right, we minus that from the total.
  rightChoice = coins[right] + sum(left, right-1) - rec(left, right-1)

  ans = max(leftChoice, rightChoice)


  The above will be O(2^n) and can be reduced to a DP with N^2

  Another way to optimise this, is as follows,

  Now lets consider only the leftChoice (coins[left] + sum(left+1, right) - rec(left+1, right))
  When first player picks up coins[left] from the left, the second player now has two options, 
  
  either pick coint[left+1] or coins[right] and play the game further, which will be rec(left+2, right) and rec(left+1, right-1),
  In the second iteration B will make sure A gets the min passed back to the fist recursion (B plays optimally)
  So what A will get from the second recursion is Min(rec(left+2, right), rec(left+1, right-1)).

  So the original recursion can be updated as follows,
  leftChoice = coins[left] + sum(left+1, right) - rec(left+1, right) => coins[left] + min(rec(left+2, right), rec(left+1, right-1))
  
  How did, sum(left+1, right) - rec(left+1, right)) become min(rec(left+2, right), rec(left+1, right-1)) ?
  sum(left+1, right) - rec(left+1, right)) is called the total revenue we can get after picking coins[left]
  So, that is why sum(left+1, right) - rec(left+1, right)) became min(rec(left+2, right), rec(left+1, right-1)) based on line 33 reasoning
