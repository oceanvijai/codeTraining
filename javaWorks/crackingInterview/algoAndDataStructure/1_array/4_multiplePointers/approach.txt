Usually it is about 
1.  finding a range with a given constraint 
2.  finding pairs that eveluate to a sum/diff etc

We can see if hashing is useful to do this first.
If so, it will take space

then if we want to save space , we can use two pinter technique
Usually we can do this only if the elements are sorted

If mutiple arrays are present, see if the sum/difference is got by moving correctly in both the array
